# T1 ----
# Subtract 7 from 49. It is enough to simply write the code for it.


# In Rstudio: with the mouse cursor on the solution line, 
# press CTRL + Enter (or click 'Run' in the upper right corner).


# If the result seems correct, have it checked by the hidden test script
# by running the next line (or clicking 'Source').
codeoceanR::rt_score()
# Ignore messages about tasks you haven't worked on yet.
# (they indicate how much work is left).


# T2 ----
# Multiply 21 with 2.



# Score again now to have your solution checked.
# It is worth doing this at least once after each task!!!

# In Rstudio: CTRL + SHIFT + S to call 'source' without mouse clicks.
# This will run the whole script including rt_score().

# Run score often to find errors easily!!!

# Now continue in "FP14_Exercises_2.R"
