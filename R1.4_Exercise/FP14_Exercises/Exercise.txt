FP14 Exercises
======================
This exercise has some simple tasks to demonstrate how the CodeOcean / Rstudio system works.  
It is recommended to solve the tasks in Rstudio (not the browser), as the exam would be very hard in the latter.

- `Download` and save the zip folder where you'd like it to be (no need to unzip).  
- Close this browser tab, otherwise CodeOcean will autosave this _empty(!)_ exercise periodically.  
- In R/Rstudio, run `codeoceanR::rt_create()`, see lesson 1.4 and [instructions](https://github.com/openHPI/codeoceanR#students).
