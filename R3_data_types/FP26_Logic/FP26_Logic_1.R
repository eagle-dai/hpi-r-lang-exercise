# Keep the order of occurrence.

# T2 ----
# Select all numbers that belong to the group "b".
# Tip: a useful (slide) search keyword is "filter"...
numbers_b <- 0


# T3 ----
3 < "b" # shows that R considers numbers to be "smaller" than letters.

# Put the following entries in ascending order.
# Don't change the line contents, correct their order relative to each other.
# The "smallest" is to be moved to the top, the "largest" should be at the bottom.
# Tip: compare them with each other - individually or in a clever way.
# Pro tip: hold ALT key + press arrow up/down: moves line
# t3_start # keep solution below this line
