# T1 ----
# Determine statistical measures in a vector containing (in that order):
# arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 70-Percentile*
# *: 30% of values are greater than this value
# Vector names are not tested in this task, feel free to ignore them.
# t1_start  # write below this marker
stats <- 0
# t1_end


# Last reminder: score many times, e.g. after each task.
# The messages will guide you towards the intended solution.


# T2 ----
# Sort 'values' in descending order.
values_sorted <- 0


# T3 ----
# What are the mean and median if the fourth element of 'values' would be 658 instead of 258?
# Pro tip: The replace() function can save code here.
# 'values' itself may not be changed, of course: 
# in reality, the original data should normally be preserved.
v_different_mean <- 0
v_different_median <- 0

# B1 ---- 
# ungraded and unchecked Bonus task:
# Which of these changed relative to the original mean/median and why (not)?
