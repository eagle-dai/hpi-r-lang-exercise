# T3 ----
# Create the following objects according to their title.
# Use code, not a number entered manually.

three_to_the_power_of_two <- 3^2
half_of_pi <- pi / 2
sixty_factorial <- factorial(60)
e_to_the_power_of_4 <- exp(4)
base_ten_logarithm_of_200 <- log10(200)


# T4 ----
# What objects are now in the global environment workspace?
# Instead of just displaying this, store it in an object.
list_of_objects <- ls()
list_of_objects


# Again: score after each task to see if you've solved it correctly.
# Occasionally, a correct solution may not be accepted by the testing script.
# Please contact me in such a case so I can expand the range of possible solutions.


# T5 ----
# This is a multiple-choice-like question with an association question.
# Replace the zeros after the terms with the number of the associated explanation below. 
# Not all explanations belong to one of the listed technical terms.
object <- 7 # this is the intended structure, replace the 5 with the right number
argument <- 5
assignment <- 6
command <- 2
workspace <- 4
operator <- 9
# 1 Working directory (folder) on the PC where R reads / writes files.
# 2 A function that executes something
# 3 A self-written function with curly braces
# 4 R-internal memory with all objects
# 5 Input parameter of a function
# 6 The creation of an object with the operator <- 
# 7 Element/instance/structure of programming, aka 'variable', e.g. for values, tables, statistical models
# 8 Creation of round brackets to call a function
# 9 Arithmetic statement (+,-,/,*,^), also relational (<,==) or logical (&,!)
