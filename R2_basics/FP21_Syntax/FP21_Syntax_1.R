codeoceanR::rt_score() # See instructions in lesson 1.4 Exercises

# T1 ----
# Create an object with the name 'resultDivision'.
# It should contain the result of the following calculation:
# 0,3 divided by 4

resultDivision <- 0.3 / 4

# Have your code scored after each task.
# Score even if you get stuck:
# the test messages become increasingly specific and helpful.
# CTRL + SHIFT + S is the easiest way to see the current score.



# T2 ----
# Divide 0,3 by 4 and multiply the result with the root of 313600. Assign it to 'resultRoot'.
# Pro tip: Assignment arrow including spaces with 'ALT' and '-'. Keys

resultRoot <- 0.3 / 4 * sqrt(313600)

# To test your solutions, objects are often required.
# This gives you the freedom to design the solution.
# To save you work, the desired object name is often given with a 0.
# Then that 0 is to be replaced with the actual code solving the task.
# Concrete code is checked only occasionally. 
# If you have questions about your solution, please write in the forum!
# For best visibility, please start your thread under the corresponding video
