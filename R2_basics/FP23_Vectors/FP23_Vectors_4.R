# T14 ----
# Write three different methods (one line of code each) to generate the numbers 1 to 10.
# They should be fundamentally different (not just a different argument in the same function).
# One of the 3 would not be used in reality because it is unnecessarily cumbersome.
# t14_start # write solution below this line

# t14_end # write solution above this line


# T15 ----
# What is the main difference between the following two lines?
c(5, 3, -8)       # A
vec <- c(5,3,-8)  # B
# 1. spaces are used in A.
# 2. A displays the result, B assigns it to an object.
# 3. A and B essentially do the same thing.
rightAnswerNumber <- 0 # replace the 0 with the number of the right answer.
