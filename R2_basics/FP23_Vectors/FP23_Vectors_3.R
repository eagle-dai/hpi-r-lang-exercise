numberSequence <- seq(1, 20, len=15)

# T11 ----
# How many elements are in 'numberSequence'? 
# Use the correct command within the following section.
# No object needs to be created - the code between t*_start and t*_end is checked.
# It is sufficient to call the function which determines how many elements a vector contains.
# As input to that function, select "numberSequence". 
# t11_start # write solution below this line

# t11_end # write solution above this line


# T12 ----
# What is the result of numberSequence[30]? 
element30 <- 0
# Feel free to write in the forum: Why? 
if(FALSE) # leave this line to not run the next line each time when scoring

# ToDo: change to link within course -----------------



# T13 ----
# Which command (function call) shows the first 6 elements of 'numberSequence'? 
# t13_start # write solution below this line

# t13_end # write solution above this line
