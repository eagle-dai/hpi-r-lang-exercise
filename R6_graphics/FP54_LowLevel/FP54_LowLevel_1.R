# As before, the graphic testing is more strict than I'd like.
# Feel free to develop alternatives outside of the code sections.


# T1 ----
# Plot the 'rate' over 'conc' from the built-in 'Puromycin' dataset.
# Use large (twice the normal size) filled dots and turn the axis labels upright.
# Color the points by 'state', with the custom colors 'puroCol':
puroCol <- c("orange", "mediumpurple2")
# Hint: 5.1 slide "Vector of custom colors"
# Tip: use a formula!
# t1_start # write solution below this line

# t1_end # write solution above this line


# T2 ----
# Add a legend at the bottom right with the two states. Tip: levels
# Use the same colors, dot types and size.
# Note: the argument cex will set font size as well.
#       Read the legend documentation for the argument to only set point size.
# Note: For the test script, you have to name the 'legend' argument explicitely.
# t2_start # write solution below this line

# t2_end # write solution above this line
