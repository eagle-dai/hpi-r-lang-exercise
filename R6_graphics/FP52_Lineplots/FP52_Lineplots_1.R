codeoceanR::rt_score()

# Again, testing graphics automatically is hard.
# Checking code is truly not perfect, but I don't know a better system.
# Unfortunately, a lot of freedom is lost here.
# Feel free to write alternatives outside of the code sections (as personal notes)!

# t1_start # write solution below this line


# t1_end # write solution above this line

# T1 ----
# Draw the temperature from 'airquality' (New York, 1973) as a line graph.
# Note: for a single vector, the argument name 'x' actually means the Y coordinates.
# See 5.1 additional slide "Vector input".

# T2 ----
# Double the line width. 
# Make it dotted.
# Use the "chocolate" color for the line.

# T3 ----
# Suppress the drawing of the vertical axis numbers.
# Hint: 5.1 slide "Suppress axis labeling"
# Note: in 5.4, we'll get to custom axis labeling, where this will be useful.
