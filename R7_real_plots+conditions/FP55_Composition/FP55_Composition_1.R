codeoceanR::rt_score()

# Feel free to solve task 2+3 before task 1 so each sourcing shows the difference nicely :)
# Comment out the rt_score command above to have faster source runs.

# T1 ----
# Change the margin settings and background color for your graphics device. 
# In doing so, assign the original settings to 'oldparams'.
oldparams <- 0
# - bottom and left margins should be 3 lines of text, top 2, at the right 0.5
# - Axis labels (x/ylab) should be placed at 1.8 units, numbers at line 0.7, the axis line at 0.
# - All numbers (on the y axis as well) should be set upright.
# - The background color for the entire graph canvas should be "rosybrown"


# T2 ----
# Display 500 normally distributed random numbers in a scatterplot.
# t2_start

# t2_end


# T3 ----
# Create a barplot of WorldPhones divided by 1000 with non-stacked bars.
# t3_start

# t3_end


# T4 ----
# Add a box around the plot region
# t4_start

# t4_end


# T5 ----
# Add a 7 units thick forestgreen box at the outer edge around the entire graphic.
# Choose the option that will work for a multipanel graphic (e.g. with oma) as well.
# t5_start

# t5_end


# T6 ----
# Reset the parameters with code (not by closing the device).
# t6_start

# t6_end

# If you like, plot some numbers again to see the changes.


# Now continue in "FP56_Composition_2.R"
