# T5 ----
# Set up a two-panel plot (below each other) with small (< 3.1) margins and axis numbers upright.


# T6 ----
# Create a barplot of the column means of the built-in dataset 'mtcars'.
# t6a_start

# t6a_end
# Plot a histogram of the mtcars columns mpg, cyl and disp. (One per script section.)
# t6b_start

# t6b_end
# t6c_start

# t6c_end
# t6d_start

# t6d_end
parForTest <- par() # don't change or move this line 
# The following two commands are already provided, you may leave them as-is :)
# t6e_start
#stripchart(mtcars$disp)
# t6e_end
# t6f_start
#stripchart(mtcars$mpg)
# t6f_end


# T7 ----
# Export all graphs of this script to a pdf with the name "realplots_out.pdf".
# It should have a height of 10 inches.
# Remember where the par call must be relative to the pdf call to take effect in the exported graph.


# Now continue in "FP61tutorial_RealPlots_3.R"
