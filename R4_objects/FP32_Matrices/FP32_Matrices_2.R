codeoceanR::rt_score()

# T6 ----
# Calculate the median of each row of the built-in matrix 'VADeaths'.
VAmedian <- 0


# T7 ----
# Calculate the range of values in each row and transpose the output,
# so that the rows remain as such and do not become columns.
VArange <- 0


# T8 ----
# Calculate the mean values of the appropriate columns in the built-in data.frame 'iris'.
# Manual column selection is fully fine here.
# Note: the solution can be very short (19 symbols), see slides for this lesson.
irisColumnAverage <- 0


# T9 ----
# Write a function that returns the second largest observation of the input.
secondMaximum <- function(x) 0
secondMaximum(   c(9,6,4) ) # should be 6
secondMaximum( c(9,9,6,4) ) # should be 9


# T10 ----
# Apply the function from T9 to each column of the built-in matrix 'stack.x'.
stackSecondMax <- 0
