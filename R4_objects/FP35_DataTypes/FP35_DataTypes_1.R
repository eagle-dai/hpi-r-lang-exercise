# T1 ----
# Create a character string representation of pi rounded to 8 digits.
pichar <- 0


# T2 ----
# Which functions show the type of objects at different levels?
type_internal_precise <- "functionNameHere"
type_internal_aggregate <- "functionNameHere"
type_user_relevant <- "functionNameHere"


# T3 ----
# Convert the built-in matrix 'WorldPhones' to a data.frame.
phonesDF <- 0


# T4 ----
# What are the advantages of a data.frame over a matrix?
advantages <- c(0,0,0) # put in the numbers of the 3 true statements.
# 1. They have column names (which matrices cannot have)
# 2. I can use the $-syntax with autocompletion for fast code development
# 3. They can contain non-numerical columns along with numerical ones
# 4. Arithmetic operations on the full dataset are easier
# 5. They are computationally faster to handle and require less memory
# 6. They are the standard object type for most data analysis projects
# 7. They can easily be extended for multidimensional data
